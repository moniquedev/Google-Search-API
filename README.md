# Google-Search-API

In class we mapped out the requirements and began to create a book search application.

Using the google books api, we request data based on the user input (either title or author of a book) and display the data returned form the API, to the user.

We want to display the  author's name, the published date, an image of the book, and a link to learn more about the book. All of this info is included in the JSON data.
